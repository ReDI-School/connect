// However, in a nutshell:
// It's a interesting TS technique, basically "forced exhaustiveness checking",
// where the code literally won't compile if you haven't checked all values of
// a union type. The great effect is that the code will automatically break if
// you add another type to the union.

  throw new Error("Didn't expect to get here")
}
