              Welcome to the ReDI School of Digital Integration and thank you
              for registering as a mentor at ReDI Connect. At ReDI we believe
              that integration starts with the simple word "Hello". So: Hello!
              With the mentorship program we want to connect our students with
              you as mentors because we think finding an answer to a question is
              easier with a counterpart than alone. Our students can benefit
              from your experience, your network, your knowledge and you are
              able to share your knowledge with new talents, maybe get new
              ideas, look at things from a different perspective or simply meet
              a great person!

            <p>
              Once you have filled out your profile you will be visible to
              students and you can receive applications. Please review any
              applications you receive and accept those you think you are ReDI
