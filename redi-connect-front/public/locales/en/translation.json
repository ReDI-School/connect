        "question": "What kind of people become mentors?",
        "answer": "We have a wide range of volunteer mentors: programmers, engineers, HR employees, entrepreneurs, advanced students. Anyone who has expertise or experience our students can learn from."
      }, {
        "question": "Why would I need a mentor?",
        "answer": "Whether you are stuck with your course work or aren’t sure what your next step will be after ReDI, everyone can benefit from having a mentor."
      }, {
        "question": "Am I ready for a mentor or should I wait?",
        "answer": "If you are unsure, please schedule a meeting with Isabelle or just come to the weekly mentorship support hours at ReDI School, every Tuesday from 5-8 pm."
      }, {
        "question": "Does the mentorship cost a lot of time for preparation/homework?",
        "answer": "This is up to you and your mentor to decide, but being prepared is always a good thing!"

      "title": "How to join",
      "qAndAs": [{
        "question": "How do I get started?",
        "answer": "4 steps: 1. Fill in the sign up form to provide the first information for your ReDI Connect profile, 2. See Isabelle and get your profile activated, 3. Update your profile to be as complete as possible and 4. Mentees (students) can now see the mentor profiles, they look for the ones that fit best and start applying to mentors. Mentors wait for applications. When they receive an application they let the student know as soon as possible if they are ReDI for this mentorship relationship."
      }, {
        "question": "Why do I have to see Isabelle before I can start?",
        "answer": "We as ReDI like to keep all people involved in the project close together and as a community. This also means that we like to know everyone personally. In those personal meetings with Isabelle or one of her colleagues, we like to get to know everyone better and become an understanding of the motivation to be with us. It helps to achieve 'using technology to break down barriers and connect the leaders of tomorrow.'"

      "title": "Getting started",

        "question": "How do I find the right mentor?",

      }, {
        "question": "What happens after I’ve sent an application?",
        "answer": "The mentor will receive an email about your application and hopefully review it soon and give you an answer. If you do not receive an answer in 2/3 days, try applying to more mentors that meet your criteria."
      }, {
        "question": "How many applications can/should I send?",
        "answer": "You can apply to multiple mentors at the same time, but be aware that the first one to accept will be your mentor. If you prefer one, apply to that one first and wait for an answer. If you do not get an answer soon, or have found multiple good options, apply to 3 or 4 mentors."
      }, {
        "question": "How can I update or improve my profile?",
        "answer": "Go to my profile and upload a photo and share some more info about yourself. Make sure your information is accurate and as complete as possible. The more you share about yourself, the easier it is for a mentor to see if and how they can help you. If you already have a portfolio, share your github or ..."

When you receive an application, read it carefully and decide if you will be able to help this student and answer them as soon as possible. In case you decline, please explain to the student why you think you are not the best match for them."
      }, {
        "question": "How can I update or improve my profile?",
        "answer": "Go to 'my profile' and upload a photo and share some more info about yourself. For our students, it is important to get an idea of who you are, what it is like to collaborate with you and how you might be able to help them. A picture and some personal info creates trust."
      }, {
        "question": "What do I do if I do not want to receive any more applications?",
        "answer": "Please go to your profile page and check your mentee maximum. If it currently too high for you, please edit it. If you do not want to be a mentor for a while you can just select '0' for the mentee count."

        "question": "How does the matching work?",
        "answer": "All mentors and mentees create a profile with information that helps them find the right match. Mentees browse mentor profiles and apply to the ones that have the expertise or experience they need. Mentors review applications from mentees and decide if they can help them based on the student’s profile and application message."
      }, {
        "question": "How can I create a good profile?",
        "answer": "Share all the information that might be relevant to collaboration style and finding out what you can and want to accomplish together. Share your professional or education info, but also something personal and upload a photo to give others an idea of who you are."

        "question": "Is there any location we can always meet?",
        "answer": "If possible, it would be great if you could meet at the office space of the mentor. Many mentors and mentees also meet in Café. You can also come to ReDI School but please inform Isabelle beforehand so we can see if there is space."
      }, {
        "question": "How often and for how long should I meet my mentee?",
        "answer": "We set a minimum of 6 sessions in around 6 months, for 1 hour each time. However, a lot of people meet more often and usually for more than an hour. (1,5 or 2 hours seems to be a good time to get something done). The meetings can be scheduled whenever you want to. We just would like you to document all meetings on the ReDI Connect platform."

      "title": "Planning Sessions",
      "qAndAs": [{
        "question": "How can we structure our mentoring sessions?",
        "answer": "For your first meeting you can focus on getting to know each other and work on setting goals together. Some students already have clear long term goals. In those cases, you can think carefully about concrete, realistic goals for the next 6 months that bring you closer to your long term goals. However, a lot of students are not sure how to move forward, in which area to specialize or how to find about realistic opportunities for the upcoming years. In these cases, your goals can be to gain insights into one or a few specialization areas, or which skills are best to focus on developing further. For more specific guidelines check out the session guidelines."

        "answer": "There can be different reasons for having the feeling the mentorship should not continue. And that is totally okay. You can then use the option to contact Isabelle on your mentorship dashboard. Isabelle and her colleagues will help you find a solution, solving problems or finding another mentor. It’s all better than staying with a mentor you don’t want to meet."
      }, {
        "question": "What should I do if my mentee has any issues I can’t / am not qualified to resolve?",
        "answer": "If you mentee comes to you with any serious issues not related to the scope of the mentorship relationship (e.g. skill-building or job search), please contact ReDI School immediately @.....  Especially, please do not try to resolve psychological or financial issues yourself."
