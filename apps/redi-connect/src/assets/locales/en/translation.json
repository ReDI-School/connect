          {
            "question": "What is ReDI's definition of mentorship?",
            "answer": "A definition that some ReDI mentors came up with is the following: “A mentor is a trusted sparring partner for the mentee whose task is to provide more or less structured guidance for the mentee’s individual development and learning process by empowering the mentee to learn about and to gain control over their very own resources. Although goals are very individual on a concrete level, a general goal of mentorship could be summed up as enabling the mentee to better cope with their topics using their own resources in the future.”"
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I get started?",
            "answer": "Follow these steps:  <b>If you wish to be a Mentor:</b> First, Sign up as a mentor and fill out your profile information. After you submit your profile for review, make sure you book an onboarding call with one of our team members to know all about the mentorship program, its dynamics and what to expect as a mentor. <b>If you wish to be a Mentee:</b> Sign  up as a mentee using the email address you used to sign up for your ReDI course,  remember: only registered ReDI students can join the platform as mentees. After signing up, make sure you fill out your profile information and submit it for review. You need to wait for the approval of your profile to get access to our mentors profiles database."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does the matching process work?",
            "answer": "ReDI connect works with two phases of matching. The first phase starts with the mentees’ initiative to search for a suitable mentor. A Mentee can do that - only if they have an approved profile- through the “find a mentor” tab. They can filter through the database of the mentors profiles and send mentorship applications to the mentors they are interested in. The second phase comes from the mentor side: a mentor can accept or decline mentorship applications according to the mentees’ expectations and profiles. It is also important to note that Mentor’s don’t have access to Mentees’ profiles database, they only can view a mentee’s profile when a mentee sends them a mentorship application."
          },
          {
            "question": "How much time does the mentorship require?",
            "answer": "Mentorships at ReDI are flexible and goal oriented. What we suggest is  a mentorship duration of about 4-6 sessions, although it can be extended if needed. The frequency and duration of the  sessions are up to you and your mentor/mentee to decide, based on your goals and the time commitment each party can make. To make sure you are making the most of each session, remember that preparation is key.  Also, bear in mind that you can still use the time between sessions to exchange updates and answer questions."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I communicate with my Mentor/Mentee?",
            "answer": "ReDI Connect doesn’t have a messaging system. So to communicate with your Mentor/Mentee after the match happens you need to send them a message via e-mail. You can use any platform you prefer for communication. This is not only convenient but also prepares mentees for using various platforms for meetings and communication in the future during their career path."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I create a good profile?",
            "answer": "To create a good profile, share all relevant information to help others determine if you would be a good match. Be as specific as possible about what you aim to accomplish together. Include details about your professional and educational background, as well as some personal information (only what you're comfortable sharing). Uploading a photo can also help others get a better idea of who you are and build trust."
          },
          {
            "question": "If I have any questions, whom should I contact?",

Our mentors are wonderful volunteers who generously dedicate their time and passion to support our learners on their journey. Their commitment helps make the mentoring experience impactful and accessible for everyone. <b>Important:</b> If at any point a mentor suggests or refers you to a paid service where they are a direct beneficiary, please report this to us immediately at <a href=‘mailto:career@redi-school.org’>career@redi-school.org</a> <b>(for ReDI Schools in Germany)</b> and at <a href=‘mailto:career.sweden@redi-school.org’>career.sweden@redi-school.org</a> <b>(for ReDI School in Sweden)</b>. We want to ensure that all mentorship remains free and aligned with ReDI's values of volunteer-driven support."

          {
            "question": "Will ReDI School check in with me to see how my long-term mentorship is going?",
            "answer": "Yes! If your mentorship has continued for over three months, we'll reach out to hear about your experience, including any highlights, milestones, or challenges. Your feedback is optional but invaluable, as it helps us improve the mentorship program to keep it meaningful for everyone involved. You can also unsubscribe from these check-in emails by unchecking a box in your Profile Settings."

            "answer": "Anyone with expertise or experience in the European market that our students can learn from can become a mentor. Our volunteer mentors come from various fields, including programming, engineering, design, HR, entrepreneurship, marketing, data science, and management."
          },
          {
            "question": "Am I ReDI to become a mentor?",
            "answer": "If you're unsure about becoming a mentor, don't worry. You can sign up and schedule a call with someone from our team to learn more about the program. Together, you can decide if it's the right time for you to become a mentor."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I pick the mentoring topics in my profile?",
            "answer": "The mentoring topics in your profile indicate to prospective mentees the areas where you can offer support. Choose the topics you feel comfortable and confident mentoring in. You can select as many topics as you want, but it's advisable to focus on those that best reflect your skills and expertise, and the focus you want to bring to your mentorship relationship. Keep in mind that mentees can only select up to four mentoring topics to reflect their most urgent support needs."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I get matched with a mentee?",
            "answer": "To get matched with a mentee, ensure your profile accurately reflects your expertise. After that, simply wait for mentees to apply to you. When you receive an application, you'll get an email notification and can review it on the ReDI Connect platform. You can then decide if you can help the student and respond as soon as possible. If you feel you're not the best match, please provide feedback to the student so they can seek another mentor. Remember, it may take some time to receive an application, so be patient."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I update or improve my profile?",
            "answer": "To update or improve your profile, go to <a href='https://connect.redi-school.org/app/me'>'My Profile'</a> and add more information about yourself. Including a photo can also help attract more attention. For students, it’s important to get a sense of who you are, what it’s like to collaborate with you, and how you can assist them. Adding personal details can build trust and connection. If you have a portfolio, consider sharing your GitHub or a link to other portfolio sites to showcase your work."
          },
          {
            "question": "How to stop receiving further applications?",
            "answer": "To stop receiving further applications, go to your profile page and check your mentee count capacity. If it's currently too high, you can edit it to a lower number. If you want to take a break from mentoring, set your mentee count capacity to '0'. This will make your profile invisible and prevent any new applications from being sent to you."
          },
          {
            "question": "What to do if my mentee comes to me with issues I am not qualified to answer?",
            "answer": "If your mentee approaches you with any significant issues beyond the scope of your mentorship, kindly reach out to us at <a href='mailto:career@redi-school.org'>career@redi-school.org</a> <b>(for ReDI Schools in Germany)</b> and at <a href='mailto:career.sweden@redi-school.org'>career.sweden@redi-school.org</a> <b>(for ReDI School in Sweden)</b>. You can also reach out to the mentorship community on slack. Please refrain from attempting to address psychological or financial matters independently. We maintain a connection with Ipso, an organization providing online psychosocial counseling, and can facilitate their support for your mentee when needed."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a way to meet the ReDI Connect Community?",
            "answer": "Yes, you can meet the ReDI Connect Community in several ways. Before each new semester, we typically organize info sessions for prospective ReDI volunteers. Once you become a mentor, you will be informed about upcoming events and workshops through our dedicated mentor Slack channel. Additionally, the ReDI Sweden team arranges various events for volunteers and students, and you'll receive invitations to those gatherings."

            "question": "Why might I need a mentor?",
            "answer": "A mentor can offer numerous benefits, such as providing valuable insights into the tech industry and helping you clarify your career path after ReDI School. They can assist with improving your CV and job interview skills, and offer additional support on topics related to your ReDI course. Essentially, a mentor can help you navigate your professional journey and achieve your goals more effectively."

They will help you explore the best options for your current stage and assist you in setting your professional goals. This will help you identify the areas where you would benefit most from support during your mentoring sessions."
          },
          {
            "question": "How do I find the right mentor?",
            "answer": "Make sure your profile reflects your needs and explains what you would like to get out of the mentorship. When looking for mentor profiles, use the filters to see the most relevant profiles. If you’re uncertain about which mentor to approach, feel free to contact a member of our ReDI Talent Success Team at <a href='mailto:career@redi-school.org'>career@redi-school.org</a> <strong>(for ReDI Schools in Germany)</strong> or <a href='mailto:career.sweden@redi-school.org'>career.sweden@redi-school.org</a> <strong>(for ReDI School in Sweden)</strong>. Together, we can explore potential mentorship matches."
          },
          {
            "question": "What happens after I've sent an application?",
            "answer": "After you send an application, the mentor will receive an email notification about it. They should review your application and respond to you soon. If you don’t receive a response within a week, please let us know so we can follow up. In the meantime, you can also apply to other mentors who meet your criteria."
          },
          {
            "question": "How many applications should I send?",
            "answer": "You can apply to multiple mentors at the same time, but remember that you can only have one mentor at a time, therefore the first mentor who accepts your application will be your match and all the other applications will be invalidated automatically. If you find a mentor who seems like a particularly good match, apply to them first and wait for a response. If you don’t hear back soon, you can then move on to applying to other potential mentors."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can I update or improve my profile?",
            "answer": "To update or improve your profile, go to ReDI Connect and work on <a href='https://connect.redi-school.org/app/me'>'My Profile'</a>. Ensure your information is accurate and as complete as possible. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for a mentor to assess how they can assist you. Including a photo can also help build trust and connection. If you have a portfolio, consider adding a link to your GitHub or other portfolio sites to showcase your work."
          },
          {
            "question": "Will ReDI School remind me to apply for a mentor if I remain unmatched?",
            "answer": "Absolutely! If you're still unmatched 45 days after your profile is approved, we'll send you a reminder email explaining the benefits of having a mentor and the next steps to take. You can unsubscribe from these reminder emails anytime by unchecking a box in your Profile Settings."

            "question": "What happens after the mentorship match has been created?",
            "answer": "After the mentorship match is created, it’s up to you and your mentor or mentee to get in touch and start planning your first session."
          },
          {
            "question": "What tools to use to communicate?",
            "answer": "The choice of communication tools is up to you and your mentor or mentee. You can indicate a preference in your profile or discuss and decide on the tools during your first session. You might also consider using our ReDI Slack space for communication, as many in our community are active there."
          },
          {
            "question": "Is there a location where we could meet?",
            "answer": "During the Covid-19 situation, we recommend meeting online and many people have preferred to continue with this format. If you and your mentor or mentee agree and are in the same location, you may choose to meet in person while adhering to local regulations. However, ReDI doesn’t provide meeting spaces for one:one mentorships in ReDI locations. "
          },
          {
            "question": "How often and for how long should we meet?",
            "answer": "This depends on several factors such as the goals of your mentorship and the nature of the topics that you need to discuss. In General, we  recommend having a minimum of 4 sessions over a period of about 3-6 months, with each session lasting around 1 hour. Many people find that meeting more frequently or for longer periods (1.5 - 2 hours) is more effective. Meetings can be scheduled at your convenience, but we ask mentors to log all meetings on the ReDI Connect platform."
          },
          {
            "question": "How can we structure our mentoring sessions?",
            "answer": "In your first meeting, focus on getting to know each other and setting goals together. If the student already has clear long-term goals, work on defining concrete, realistic goals for the next 6 months that will help them progress toward those long-term objectives. If the student is unsure about their direction, use the sessions to explore different specialization areas and identify key skills to develop. For more specific guidance, mentors can connect with other mentors via our Slack space or attend regular mentors’ gatherings."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does the mentorship match end?",
            "answer": "The mentorship match ends when both the mentor and mentee feel that they have achieved their goals or in the case of agreeing that the match is no longer a good fit. The mentor can mark the mentorship as complete on the <a href='https://connect.redi-school.org/app/mentorships/'>'My Mentorship'</a> page. It's important for both parties to communicate openly about ending the mentorship to ensure a smooth transition. It’s completely normal for a mentorship to conclude when goals are met, allowing both individuals to pursue new opportunities. In rare cases where one party feels uncomfortable, please refer to the next steps for resolution"
          },
          {
            "question": "What to do if the mentorship match doesn't feel right?",
            "answer": "If the mentorship match doesn’t feel right or if you believe it should not continue, that’s completely okay. You can contact a member of our ReDI Talent Success Team <br>at <a href='career@redi-school.org'>career@redi-school.org</a> <b>(for ReDI Schools in Germany)</b> or <br><a href='career.sweden@redi-school.org'>career.sweden@redi-school.org</a> <b>(for ReDI School in Sweden)</b>. <br> We will assist you in finding a solution or arranging a new match. It's better to address these concerns rather than staying in a mentorship relationship that isn’t fulfilling or has reached its end."
