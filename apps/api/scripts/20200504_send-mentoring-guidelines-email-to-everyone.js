We hope you are doing well and would like to say THANK YOU for supporting our students in these challenging times. Thank you also if you joined one of our meetups or if you are a new mentor that signed up in the last week! We need you!

We have some great news: Since the start of our semester in February over 100 hours of mentoring have been logged: Keep going! This is fantastic!

We have nominated one ambassador so that you have someone to reach out to or if you want to share your mentoring experience: His name is Dragos and he has mentored five students already and is happy to help or talk. Find him on slack: dragosgn

We have put together some tips and tricks for (online) mentoring for you in the attached file.

Let us know if we should add something! In the meantime: T-H-A-N-K Y-O-U AGAIN!

See you online!

Best,
Isabelle, Dragos & everyone at ReDI School`,
