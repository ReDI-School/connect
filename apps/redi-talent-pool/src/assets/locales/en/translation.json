            "answer": "Including a photo in your profile is a personal choice. Some users find that adding a photo helps others get to know them and can contribute to building trust. However, the decision is entirely up to you, and if you're more comfortable without a photo, that's absolutely fine. Choose what aligns with your preferences and makes you feel most at ease on the platform."

            "question": "What is a CV Builder?",
            "answer": "The CV Builder is a special tool developed for ReDI talents. It lets you create and download your CV for job applications. Studies say recruiters only look at a CV for about 2 minutes the first time. That's why it's crucial to keep it concise, focusing on the key details and fitting it on one page. This helps make a great first impression and increases your chances of getting an interview invite."

          {
            "question": "If I want to hire a ReDI student, what do I need to be aware of?",
            "answer": "If you hire one of our students we kindly ask you to report this to us. We are a non-profit organization and our internal structures demand that we document all our activities. Therefore we also must know when and where our students find employment."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do ReDI candidates need any additional support for their (job) integration?",
            "answer": "As an employer you are not expected to take over the responsibility to integrate ReDI candidates. It is only advisable that you allow a smooth integration into the new job, just like it is for every new employee. Some ReDI students do not have perfect German skills and are new to the German work culture, but all of them are willing to learn and will make an effort if you provide them with an opportunity. If you are open, welcoming and curious, we are sure that your new employee will be too."
          },
          {
            "question": "Which kind of job seekers are looking for jobs on the ReDI Talent Pool? ",

The ReDI community consists of 104 different nationalities, over 60% identify themselves as female and more than 70% have obtained a university degree (on top of the ReDI certification). Yes - we are proud of our diversity!"

          {
            "question": "Do ReDI job seekers have a specific professional background?",
            "answer": "The short answer is no. ReDI students come from different countries and have different backgrounds. Some ReDI students come to Germany with profound tech knowledge and many have already studied at the University in their home country, others have a different (academic) background and seek to start a career in the German tech industry. All ReDI students have one thing in common though: Their interest in tech and their strong motivation to start a new career in Germany."
          },
          {
            "question": "Are there any requirements for accessing the ReDI Talent Pool as a company?",
            "answer": "The ReDI Talent Pool serves as a safe space for the ReDI Community and therefore it is also not open to everybody. To access the ReDI Talent Pool as a company representative your company must be a ReDI Career Partner. You should get in touch with our partnership team (partner@redi-school.org) in order to find out how to become a ReDI Career Partner."
          },

            "question": "Must I pay to post a job application on the ReDI Talent Pool? ",

          },
          {
            "question": "Must I pay to hire ReDI candidates?",
            "answer": "We do not charge anything once you hire a ReDI candidate, quite on the contrary: We are stoked about every ReDI alumni who finds their way into the tech industry. What we ask for is that you notify us - Remember, we are a non-profit organization and we must document all our activities."
