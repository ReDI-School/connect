/**
 * Eric Bolikowski, 04 May 2021.
 * Alright, this was a strange issue. We needed to put in place the above webpack configuration
 * which changes how the redi-talent-pool app is built. There's an entry in `workspace.json`
 * that ensures that this file right here is being run:
 * workspace.json > projects > redi-talent-pool > targets > build > options > webpackConfig
 *
 * Before the above stuff was put in place the followig errors made it impossible to build
 * redi-talent-pool:
 * ********************************

 * After a lot of googling I finally came across this guy that had the same issue:
 * https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/4817
 *
 * Following up his fix of `node: undefined` fixed everything.
 * Other resorces that were used to figure out how to set up this file:
 * - https://nx.dev/latest/node/core-concepts/configuration (refernce on options in workspace.json)
 * - https://yonatankra.com/how-to-use-custom-webpack-configuration-in-a-nrwl-project/#customizationSteps
 *   (guide on how to customize webpack config)
 * - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/3175 (aonther good example on customizing webpack config)
 * - https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/ (webpack config reference)
