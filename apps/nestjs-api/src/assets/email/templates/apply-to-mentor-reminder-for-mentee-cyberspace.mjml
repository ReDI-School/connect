            >You are receiving this email because you had your activation call a few days 
            ago but have not yet applied to any mentor on ReDI Connect. As mentioned in 
            the call, <strong>you should apply for at least one mentor for your profile to stay 
            active</strong>.</mj-text

            >We always think of ReDI Connect as a means to an end, not an end in itself, 
            meaning that ReDI Connect is a tool to connect you with mentors. Therefore, to 
            make the most out of the tool, you should take the initiative and start 
            applying.</mj-text

          <mj-text mj-class="text paragraph" 
            >1. If you have not done so already, please complete your profile on
            ReDI Connect (Most important: clear expectations and goals. Nice to have: 
            a picture and a link to your LinkedIn profile). This helps future mentors 
            understand whether you two can be a good match.</mj-text
          >
          <mj-text mj-class="text paragraph"
            >2. When you are done, please start searching for a mentor on the platform 
            (under 'Find a mentor'). You can send an application message to a mentor 
            directly through their profile. You can apply to as many mentors as you find 
            interesting, but remember that you can only have one mentor at a time, and the 
            one who accepts you first will become your mentor.</mj-text

          <mj-text mj-class="text paragraph" 
            >3. You should receive an answer from at least one of the mentors within one week. 
            This, however, varies from one mentor to another. As a general rule, if you need 
            a match as soon as possible, apply for several mentors to increase the chances 
            of a quick match.
