${menteeName} who applied to become your mentee also applied to another mentor. The other mentor just accepted the application a tiny bit faster ;).

The application to you from ${menteeName} has therefore expired, and you will not see it any longer in ReDI Connect.

Other mentees can of course still apply to you, and we're sure you'll receive another application soon to be a great mentor to one of our students!
