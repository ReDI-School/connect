Your profile has been accepted and you are now able to see and apply to you future mentor. Just go to ReDI Connect here: ${buildFrontendUrl(
      process.env.NODE_ENV
    )}.

Please make sure you update your profile regularly and upload your profile picture.

Please make sure that once your mentor has accepted your application, to schedule regular meetings with him or her. They are giving their precious time to support you. You should have: 

At least 6 meetings in total ( 1:1 or in a small group) // Approx. one session (60 mins.) per month (can be more)
Last semester, those students who had a mentor were more successful in their courses, found jobs and internships easier and understood their own goals much better.  A mentor can support you throughout the semester with:  
help with your course
career advice 
job orientation 
help to find an internship/job 
Please note: First come, first serve. Whoever applies first, will get a mentor first. And remember: All successful people have a mentor: Do you know who the mentor of Bill Gates was?

${menteeName} who applied to become your mentee also applied to another mentor. The other mentor just accepted the application a tiny bit faster ;).

The application to you from ${menteeName} has therefore expired, and you will not see it any longer in ReDI Connect.

Other mentees can of course still apply to you, and we're sure you'll receive another application soon to be a great mentor to one of our students!
